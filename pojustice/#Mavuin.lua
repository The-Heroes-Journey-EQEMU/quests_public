The followers in the Plane of Tranquility are trying to find information on what has happened to Zebuxoruk. What I know is that he has been captured for a second time. If you want to find out more information I believe you should seek an audience with Karana and Mithaniel Marr. I can only assume that they were present at the time of his capture and know why this has taken place. Also seek from Marr a way to translate the divine language. Only with it can you understand the writing of the gods. There is no more that I can tell you, but thank you once again for your attempt in returning my freedom.")
