# Library for spawning tutorial popups
# popups have an ID which is 628<three digit ID>0
# popup button IDs use the least significant digit of the ID as 0 for default button (popup_id in Popup2 definition) and 9 is for negative_id
# three hashes define them. %popups is friendly name to ID, %popups_text is ID => text, %popups_title is ID=>title
