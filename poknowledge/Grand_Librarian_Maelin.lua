It is a detailed as a crystal that burns with all the powers of the plane of fire. It is said to have the ability to turn the face of Norrath into a charred wasteland.

It was a great marvel to see indeed. I found the creator of all things mechanical. Meldrath the Marvelous was a kind and just gnome. We spent many weeks together discussing all of his devices. This included a machine that would allow you to open a tear into a period of time and enter into that time. The machine was more of a flight of whimsy though as the power necessary to power such a machine was enormous. He jokingly equated needing the very essence of the elements to power it.");

Let us suppose that you travelers could venture into the Elemental Planes and retrieve this essence; and form it into one powerful conglomeration. You could open a tear into the period of time before Zebuxoruk was imprisoned. There is no way you can free him from his stasis now, but if you were to halt the Pantheon at the time of imprisonment. Hah! It could work I do believe. Forgive me, but my old gnomish heart is alive with the excitement of possibilities. Gather up your strength friends, travel into the deep elements. You will need all of your wits about you. Find the very essence of the elementals, and fuse them into one. How to combine them I do not know, and can only wish you luck on finding that information. If you can accomplish this please come get me. I would like to record the events as they take place!");
